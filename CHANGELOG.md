## 0.3.0  

- This is the initial public release of IdeaSpace.
- The focus of the initial release is on managing images and providing a basic photo sphere theme.
- Images which are uploaded are resized to fit the "power of two rule" for textures and thumbnail images are created for the navigation menu.
- The theme API is kept to a minimum at this release. The only implemented controls are images and text.
- There are two example themes shipped with this release: a photo sphere viewer and a hello world theme. 
- Published spaces can be embedded on external websites by using the embed code provided on the space edit page. IdeaSpace implements CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) in order to allow loading of assets from a different domain name.
- The front page features a list of latest published spaces or a single space (configure in "Settings").
